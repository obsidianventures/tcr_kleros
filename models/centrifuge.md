# Centrifuge Model



1. **Evidence** - these are contracts and documents that architect what the token model looks like and is made up of. For example, each token model will be a list of certain sets of documents/samples that would be provided as part of the framework. The evidence in this case wil almost always be templates of the documents that are being used to create the digital versions of the tokens for the end-user of the real world assets. In this case, the end users are MakerDAO vault owners;
2. **Badge** - each token model will be provided with a "Badge". The Badge will be denominated by colors and will determine the status of the models as they are being arbitrated.
   1. Green: the token model has been approved by Kleros jurors;
   2. Red: the token model has been challenged and does not pass the quality test of Kleros jurors;
   3. Yellow: the token model is currently being arbitrated;
   4. Orange: the token model has been provisionally approved pending certain changes to the templates, structures or other documents provided in the decision by Kleros jurors;
3. **Requirement** - each token model and TCR will come with a set of requirements that summarize how the token model meets legal criteria to be listed as a token. The requirements serve as a summary of the token model and its primary characteristics.
4. **Workflow** token models for real world asset securiites can be confusing. Each TCR for a token model will provide a workflow that summarizes step-by-step how the process of operating the model works.
5. **Compliance** - Each TCR will provide a framework for how it will meet certain compliance measures, especially those related to data protection, KYC and AML while on the blockchain.



# Evidence

New Silver Lending LLC used a series of documents and contracts to create the structure:

1. **Limited Liability Operating Agreement -** this agreement governs the relationship between New Silver Lending LLC and NS Pool, an SPV created for this structure above. The LLC Agreement creates the structure for New Silver Lending LLC to be able to operate the LLC and create additional Series of companies.

2. A **Collateral Assignment of Mortgage and Note -** this assigned the assets owed to New Silver Lending LLC to NS Pool, where NS Pool has the right to receive payments but New Silver Lending LLC actually continues to own the collateral. NS Pool purchased the assigned rights for $10.00. NS Pool only receives assigned rights for the collateral, but isn't actually the overall owner of that collateral**.**

3. **Executive Summary -** to announce and describe the major aspects of the tokens DROP and TIN distribution.

4. Centrifuge License -

    New Silver Lending LLC uses Centrifuge's blockchain platform to issue the tokens, and uses a series of documents to do so. Centrifuge is backed by Securitize technology, all anchored on Ethereum ERC-20 standards.

   1. **Securitize Sublicense Agreement -** an agreement that centrifuge is sublicensing its technology to NS Pool to a white label security token platform.
   2. **License Agreement between Securitize & Centrifuge -** a license agreement showing that Centrifuge relies on the Securitize platform to offer its services;
   3. **Tinlake Protocol Service Agreement -** governs the operation of the tokens and protocol to issue the TIN and DROP tokens. It governs things like fiat to DAI conversions into the pool, management teams and operations of the tokens.

5. Subscription Agreements TIN & DROP -

    the terms of the purchase for DROP and TIN tokens. These look very much like security purchase agreements in a Series A, and spell out the operations of how the tokens work. One of the most important aspects of these agreements are:

   1. DROPs are paid before TIN holders;
   2. DROP and TIN token holders **do not** have security interests in NS Pool LLC.
   3. Payments only happen when an investor asks for them by explicitly redeeming DROP or TIN tokens for payment of DAI.

6. **Purchase and Loan Agreements -** these are the agreements that New Silver Lending LLC will enter into in order to fix, and then flip the properties. *Presumably*, these govern the terms of how homes are funded to eventually create the collateral loans to be repaid to New Silver Lending LLC by homeowners, construction companies, etc.
